# Habari2md

This is a dirty little Ruby program to export a [Habari][habari] blog to
markdown format.  I used it to avoid installing PHP on a small VPS in order to
run a tiny blog of ~2000 posts.

The program makes a few assumptions about your setup, and this conditions what
you should expect to get from it.

  * It will connect to a MariaDB/MySQL database,
  * fetch all of its posts and:
    * dump one file per published post in the `out` directory ;
    * use a filename like `YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md` where `YYYY-MM-DD` are the
      year, month, and month day when a particular post was published ;
    * and format a post header with:
        
        ```
        title: The original post title
        author: The author's username
        ```

This process can be pretty specific, and if it does not fit your setup, feel
free to file an issue or, better, send a pull-request. ;)
